[RS-232 Framework Expansion Card](https://medo64.com/rs232framecard/)
=====================================================================

This Framework laptop expansion card will show up on your system as a serial
device and allow for a serial RS-232 communication up to 115,200 baud rate.


## RS-232 Pinout

To connect to this board, one has to use a 5-pin JST XH connector. The following
table represents the pinout, pin 1 being on the left as looking into the
expansion card.

| # | Ref | Description                     | DB9 | Sym |
|--:|:---:|---------------------------------|----:|:---:|
| 1 | CTS | Clear-to-send                   |  8  |  c  |
| 2 | RXD | Receive data                    |  2  |  R  |
| 3 | GND | Ground connection               |  5  |  ⏚  |
| 4 | TXD | Transmit data                   |  3  |  T  |
| 5 | RTS | Ready-to-send                   |  7  |  r  |

As power consumption is low, wires can be almost any AWG. I would recommend
using 24 AWG wire 0.25 mm² as they allow for greater compatibility with other
connectors.


## Supported Speeds

This board employs the FT232R as its UART chip, and consequently, it supports
all the baud rates this chip [can handle](https://ftdichip.com/Documents/AppNotes/AN232B-05_BaudRates.pdf)
up to 115,200 baud which is the limit of RS-232 chip used. The table below
lists the standard baud rates.
